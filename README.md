# Multiway Tree Construction and Merging Tool

A Python package for constructing, merging, and traversing Multiway Tree (also called Non-binary Tree).

This project is packaged and published!
```bash
https://test.pypi.org/project/Treemerge/0.1.0/
```
To install and use:
```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ Treemerge==0.1.0
```

## Project Overview

This project provides functionality to construct Multiway Tree, merge two trees according to specific rules, and perform pre-order traversal on the trees. With this tool, you can:

- **Construct Trees**: Build Multiway Tree based on a given data structure.
- **Merge Trees**: Merge two trees following specified rules.
- **Pre-order Traversal**: Perform pre-order traversal to obtain a sequence of node keys and values.

## Features

- **Tree Construction**: Create Multiway Tree from lists of nodes and their child relationships.
- **Tree Merging**: Merge two trees by combining nodes and subtrees according to specific merging rules.
- **Tree Traversal**: Traverse trees in pre-order to extract node information.

## Installation

You can clone the repository directly to obtain the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jianghanyuan/Non-Binary-Tree-Merge.git
```
or:
```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ Treemerge==0.1.0
```
