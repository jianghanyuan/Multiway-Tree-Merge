# Non-Binary Tree Construction and Merging Tool

A Python tool for constructing, merging, and traversing non-binary trees.

## Project Overview

This project provides functionality to construct non-binary trees, merge two trees according to specific rules, and perform pre-order traversal on the trees. With this tool, you can:

- **Construct Trees**: Build non-binary trees based on a given data structure.
- **Merge Trees**: Merge two trees following specified rules.
- **Pre-order Traversal**: Perform pre-order traversal to obtain a sequence of node keys and values.

## Features

- **Tree Construction**: Create non-binary trees from lists of nodes and their child relationships.
- **Tree Merging**: Merge two trees by combining nodes and subtrees according to specific merging rules.
- **Tree Traversal**: Traverse trees in pre-order to extract node information.
